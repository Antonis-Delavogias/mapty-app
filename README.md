**Project Goals:**

* Build a fitness tracking app using modern JavaScript features.

* Utilize the Web APIs like Geolocation and Local Storage to provide a user-friendly experience.

* Implement a clean and modular code structure for better maintainability.

What I Learned:

* Web APIs: Gain practical experience with Geolocation API to get user location and Local Storage API to store data persistently.

* DOM Manipulation: Explore techniques to dynamically modify the HTML content of the page using methods like querySelector and insertAdjacentHTML.

* Event Listeners: Learn how to attach event listeners to elements to respond to user interactions like button clicks and map clicks.

* Classes and Inheritance: Understand object-oriented programming concepts by creating classes for workouts and extending them for specific workout types (running and cycling).

* Modularization: Discover how to break down the code into well-defined functions and classes for improved organization and reusability.

Feel free to:

* Explore the code to see how JavaScript interacts with the HTML and CSS to create the game.

* Experiment with the game logic and styling!

* Ask any questions or share improvements for this Pig Dice Game implementation.
